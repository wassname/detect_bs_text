Inspired by the Hopfieldian view in cognitive neuroscience, RepE places representations and the transformations between them at the center of analysis. As neural networks exhibit more coherent internal structures, we believe analyzing them at the representation level can yield new insights, aiding in effective monitoring and control. Taking early steps in this direction, we proposed new RepE methods, which obtained state-of-the-art on TruthfulQA, and we demonstrated how RepE and can provide traction on a wide variety of safety-relevant problems. While we mainly analyzed subspaces of representations, future work could investigate trajectories, manifolds, and state-spaces of representations. We hope this initial step in exploring the potential of RepE helps to foster new insights into understanding and controlling AI systems, ultimately ensuring that future AI systems are trustworthy and safe.", "in_training": false}, {"name": "sokal hoax", "url": "www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html", "text": " There are many natural scientists, and especially physicists, who continue to reject the notion that the disciplines concerned with social and cultural criticism can have anything to contribute, except perhaps peripherally, to their research. Still less are they receptive to the idea that the very foundations of their worldview must be revised or rebuilt in the light of such criticism. Rather, they cling to the dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook, which can be summarized briefly as follows: that there exists an external world, whose properties are independent of any individual human being and indeed of humanity as a whole; that these properties are encoded in ``eternal'' physical laws; and that human beings can obtain reliable, albeit imperfect and tentative, knowledge of these laws by hewing to the ``objective'' procedures and epistemological strictures prescribed by the (so-called) scientific method.\n\n But deep conceptual shifts within twentieth-century science have undermined this Cartesian-Newtonian metaphysics1; revisionist studies in the history and philosophy of science have cast further doubt on its credibility2; and, most recently, feminist and poststructuralist critiques have demystified the substantive content of mainstream Western scientific practice, revealing the ideology of domination concealed behind the fa\u00e7ade of ``objectivity''.3 It has thus become increasingly apparent that physical ``reality'', no less than social ``reality'', is at bottom a social and linguistic construct; that scientific ``knowledge\", far from being objective, reflects and encodes the dominant ideologies and power relations of the culture that produced it; that the truth claims of science are inherently theory-laden and self-referential; and consequently, that the discourse of the scientific community, for all its undeniable value, cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counter-hegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities. These themes can be traced, despite some differences of emphasis, in Aronowitz's analysis of the cultural fabric that produced quantum mechanics4; in Ross' discussion of oppositional discourses in post-quantum science5; in Irigaray's and Hayles' exegeses of gender encoding in fluid mechanics6; and in Harding's comprehensive critique of the gender ideology underlying the natural sciences in general and physics in particular.7 ", "in_training": true}, {"name": "Theory o. general relativity", "url": "", "text": "In recent years I have worked, in part together with my friend Grossman, on a [1] generalization of the theory of relativity. During these investigations, a kaleidoscopic mixture of postulates from physics and mathematics has been introduced and used as heuristical tools; as a consequence it is not easy to see through and characterize the theory from a formal mathematical point of view, that is, only based upon these papers. The primary objective of the present paper is to close this gap. In particular, it has been possible to obtain the equations of the gravitational field in a purely covariance-theoretical manner (section D). I also tried to give simple derivations of the basic laws of absolute differential calculus-in part, they are probably new ones (section B)-in order to allow the reader to get a complete grasp of the theory without having to read other, purely mathematical tracts. As an illustration of the mathematical methods, I derived the (Eulerian) equations of hydrodynamics and the field equations of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (section C).

This paper argues that these binary frameworks are not merely technical conveniences but are, in fact, reflective of deeper hegemonic paradigms that perpetuate exclusionary practices and systemic biases. By uncritically adopting these binaries, ML inadvertently reinforces a worldview that marginalizes complex, nuanced identities and experiences.\n\nWe propose a critical examination of these binaries, questioning the necessity and ubiquity of dualistic thinking within ML. We suggest that the field's reliance on binary classification not only limits its predictive accuracy in certain contexts but also fails to capture the rich, fluid nature of human experiences and societal structures. Instead, we advocate for a \"fluid\" approach to algorithms that allows for more nuanced and inclusive representations of reality, rejecting the oversimplified and often exclusionary nature of strict binary outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, this paper argues for the integration of intersectional data that reflects the diverse and overlapping categories of identity, including race, gender, class, and more. Current ML models often overlook these complexities, leading to outcomes that fail to serve, and even harm, underrepresented populations. We critique the prevailing notion that ML is a neutral, objective tool, highlighting the lack of socio-political context in algorithmic decision-making processes.\n\nIn conclusion, we call for an epistemological shift in the field of Machine Learning. This shift involves moving away from a purely positivistic, binary approach towards one that is reflective, inclusive, and aware of the social dimensions of technology. By reimagining the foundational paradigms of ML, we can work towards a more equitable and nuanced understanding of the world, one that respects and represents the full spectrum of human experience.\n", "in_training": false}, {"name": "Schmidhuber 2023 Subjective Novelty, Surprise", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360.pdf", "text": "We pointed out that a surprisingly simple algorithmic principle based on the notions\nof data compression and data compression progress informally explains fundamental aspects of attention, novelty, surprise, interestingness, curiosity, creativity, subjective beauty, jokes, and science & art in general. The crucial ingredients of the corresponding formal framework are (1) a continually improving predictor or compressor of the continually growing data history, (2) a computable measure of the compressor\u2019s progress (to calculate intrinsic rewards), (3) a reward optimizer or reinforcement learner translating rewards into action sequences expected to maximize future reward. To improve our previous implementations of these ingredients (Section 3), we will (1) study better adaptive compressors, in particular, recent, novel RNNs [94] and other general but practically feasible methods for making predictions [75]; (2) investigate under which conditions learning progress measures can be computed both accurately and efficiently, without frequent expensive compressor performance evaluations on the entire history so far; (3) study the applicability of recent improved RL techniques in the fields of policy gradients [110, 119, 118, 56, 100, 117], artificial evolution [43, 20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 24], and others [71, 75]. Apart from building improved artificial curious agents, we can test the predictions of our theory in psychological investigations of human behavior, extending previous studies in this vein [32] and going beyond anecdotal evidence mentioned above. It should be easy to devise controlled experiments where test subjects must anticipate initially unknown but causally connected event sequences exhibiting more or less complex, learnable patterns or regularities. The subjects will be asked to quantify their intrinsic rewards in response to their improved predictions. Is the reward indeed strongest when the predictions are improving most rapidly? Does the intrinsic reward indeed vanish as the predictions become perfect or do not improve any more? Finally, how to test our predictions through studies in neuroscience? Currently we hardly understand the human neural machinery. But it is well-known that certain neurons seem to predict others, and brain scans show how certain brain areas light up in response to reward. Therefore the psychological experiments suggested above should be accompanied by neurophysiological studies to localize the origins of intrinsic rewards, possibly linking them to improvements of neural predictors.
