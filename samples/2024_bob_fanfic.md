Bob, April 2222 Delta Eridani

 

There are moments in a replicant’s existence when you question every decision that led you to this point. For me, one of those moments was right now, standing in the middle of Camelot while every single furry, bat-eared inhabitant within sight gave me the look. Again.

It had been happening all day. Everywhere I went, a Deltan would glance at me, give me an ear waggle- their version of a knowing smile, or a frown- though that happened much less frequently, and then wander off like they’d just caught me red-handed doing… something.

And I had no idea what.

It all started when an elder had shuffled up to me with the air of someone about to impart great wisdom. “Relationships are like walking the long path,” He began with solemn gravity, heavily leaning on his walking stick. “Some steps are harder than others, but you will find balance together.”

I blinked. “Uh… thank you?”

He patted my arm, gave me a knowing smile, and toddled off before I could ask what in the world he was talking about.

It kind of snowballed from there.

 

"I’ve got your bucket!" Buster’s youngest, Samantha, grunted as she heaved a bucket twice her size up for me to take.

I took it from her, fluffing her furred head with a smile. "Thanks, buddy!"

She jumped, grinning. Her ears, too big for he small body, flapped about. "Bring us a fish, too, uncle!"

I paused, registering the last word. Oh, well. She was still young enough to mix up the honorifics now and then. Just a kid’s mistake. "I- er..." I trailed off as the little girl was snatched up by an older sibling and silenced with a hand covering her face.

She wriggled furiously in her brother's arms, but Peter held fast.

"Kids. Hahaha." Peter sheepishly smiled as he backed off with Samantha.

Was that about the fish? "I’ll— I’ll bring a fish later," I called out, still baffled, watching them go.

 

“Archimedes,” I muttered under my breath as we walked toward the water source together. “I think they know.” My mind wandered back to the glowers I’d caught aimed at me throughout the day. One of the older Deltans, Bill, had even gone so far as to cross the road when he saw me, his ears curled tight in anger.

I’d deployed a spy drone or two to eavesdrop—ahem, to discreetly gather intel on this sudden shift in mood—but the reports came back sparse and frustratingly vague. All they’d managed to scrounge up were murmurings of some event, preparations for something big. Which… was mildly worrying.

Archimedes’ ears twitched in my direction, a sign he was paying attention. “Know what?”

“That I’m the Bawbe,” I hissed. “Or that I’ve done something equally unforgivable.”

Yup, that was the obvious conclusion I’d landed on. If they weren’t planning a witch hunt, then I was completely lost. I was out of ideas. Robert hadn't done anything out of the ordinary. Robert was just Robert—the very definition of ordinary. Physically and in action. I’d made sure of it.

It made the villagers’ sudden shift in attitude all the more surprising.

Archimedes stopped dead in his tracks, his bucket swaying slightly. “Why would they think that?”

“I don’t know,” I said, glancing around nervously. “But they keep giving me these looks. It’s like they’re suspicious of me or something.”

Archimedes tilted his head, his snout wrinkling in thought—the Deltan equivalent of a raised eyebrow. “Hmm. They have been acting strangely lately,” he admitted after a moment.

So it wasn’t just me.

“Donald winked at me this morning,” I confessed, feeling my fur bristle. Was Donald being passive-aggressive? Did Deltans even know what passive-aggressiveness was?

Archimedes paused. “A slow blink?”

Right. Deltans didn’t technically have the facial musculature for winking. Their version was a deliberate slow blink paired with a slight head tilt. It looked like the world’s most patient parent indulging a clueless child. “Yeah,” I said, adjusting my translation subroutines to better clarify. “It was definitely a slow blink. Intentional. Like he was in on something.”

Archimedes tilted his head, clearly trying to process this. “Donald shushed me earlier when I tried to talk about Diana,” he said slowly.

“Shushed you?” I asked, conveying my bewilderment with an exaggerated ear flop.

“Yes.” Archimedes’ ears twitched in response, a sign he was just as baffled as I was. “I told him I was concerned for my family after Diana’s passing, and he patted my shoulder and said, ‘We understand.’”

I stared at him. “That’s… weird.” And cold. Deltans were pragmatic as a whole, but to shush someone when they confided in you about dealing with loss? That was a bit much—and very out of character for Donald.

“Very,” Archimedes agreed.

We exchanged a look. I could see the same confusion mirrored in his eyes that I was feeling.

“Do you think…” Archimedes trailed off, his ears flattening slightly.

“What?”

He hesitated, then shook his head. “Never mind.”

 

That night, I paced in tight circles in my sleeping space.

My cover was blown.

The Deltans knew I was the Bawbe, and they were waiting for the right moment to confront me. Maybe they were planning to hold some kind of village trial.

I'd already notified Marvin of the situation, but—big surprise—no response. He was probably neck-deep in one of his projects. I didn’t expect my emergencies to be his emergencies, but seriously, help a Bob out!

To make matters worse, no one in the village actually talked about it. There were plenty of gestures and exchanged looks, but no one actually said anything that made sense to me (besides the unsettling fact that they wanted to tie me up with vines at some point). It was like a very confusing, village-wide pantomime. And as I combed through my data logs, I'd realized this strange behavior had been going on far longer than just today.

A thorough review of my data logs confirmed that suspicion. Bill, the village elder, had been giving me the stink eye from what I’d initially thought was the very beginning—but that had just been me mixing up my experiences as the Bawbe with Robert’s. Bill’s appalled looks at Robert, which had later softened into a disdainful sort of disgust, were relatively new—no older than ten days. It was recent compared to Annie's much more complex behavior... which I’d summarized as some form of sympathy. Confusing, to say the least. Seemed like Cruella's vitriolic anti-Bawbe propaganda hadn’t entirely taken root. None of this explained why they had waited so long to act, though.

I was halfway through planning an escape route when Archimedes arrived.

“Robert,” he said as he stepped inside the tent. His tone was calm, but his fur was slightly puffed—a sure sign he was uneasy.

“Let me guess,” I said. “You’ve been getting weird vibes too?”

He nodded. “I have tried to speak with several villagers today. Every time, they tell me I have nothing to explain and walk away.”

“Well, that’s not creepy at all,” I said, throwing up my hands.

Archimedes hesitated. “I do not think this is about your identity,” he said after a moment.

“Then, what is it about?” I demanded.

Archimedes’ ears swiveled slightly before he spoke. “I think they believe we are mates.”

For a moment, I blue-screened. It wasn’t every day that I got hit with something this out of left field, but Archimedes had managed it. When I finally recovered, I burst out laughing. “That’s ridiculous!”

Archimedes frowned. “Is it?”

“Of course it is!” I said. “Why would they think that?” No, seriously— it was absurd. I began running through all my interactions with him, trying to pinpoint what could possibly lead to such a far-fetched conclusion.

He gave me a pointed look. “You do not have a mate and never spoke of having had one. You spend most of your time with me, and you moved in with my family and never left. Deltans do not take new mates after the death of a lifemate, so the idea of secrecy would make sense to them."

I opened my mouth to argue, but… okay—when he laid it out like that, it didn’t sound completely insane.

"Also," he continued meaningfully, "you gifted me a flower that time." Reaching up, he touched his ear. "Put it behind my ear even, in public."

I floundered for a bit, embarrassed at the mention of my shameful faux pas. I had no idea how, in all my years of observing the Deltans, I'd missed that flower-gifting was strictly reserved for mates, or potential mates. Never friends.

“…That was a mistake,” I coughed, waving a hand dismissively, as if to erase the memory.

“So was moving in, apparently,” Archimedes said dryly.

“Still,” I insisted, "your family knows the truth. We can clear up the misunderstanding."

At that exact moment, Buster and his wife Belinda walked in. They greeted Archimedes and me cordially enough, but there was an air of something about them.

I unconsciously braced myself.

"I have something for you, Robert,” Buster said after a not-so-subtle nudge from his wife. He smiled at me hopefully as he held out a small object.

I stared at the thing in puzzlement. It was a small, expertly made carving depicting two Deltans standing side by side, connected by their arms. One was unmistakably Archimedes, and the other… well, the other was definitely me. I quadruple-checked the fur patterns and the surprisingly accurate facial features. Yup, definitely us.

“I made this for you,” Buster said, his tone earnest.

“Uh, thanks?” I said, gingerly taking the carving. Alarm bells began ringing in my head.

Buster straightened his posture and beamed at me. “We wanted you to feel welcome in the family."

"Welcome to the family," Belinda echoed, smiling gently.

I stared at the carving. Then at Buster. Then at Belinda. Then at Archimedes, my mouth opening and closing like a stranded fish.

Behind Buster and Belinda, a small group of children had gathered, watching the exchange with the Deltan equivalent of shiny eyes.

"Can I call him uncle now?" Little Samantha asked before being shushed by an older sibling.

'It was at that moment that he knew he’d fucked up', I thought wryly.
