Dear Dr. Fauci: I am an ex-alumni from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH. I am sorry to
bother but I wanted to not ify the Coronavirus Task force about potential blood shortages if blood
centers get blood drive cancellations due to the fear in the public.
We are starting to see this locally and my concern is that other blood centers in the country are facing
the same issue.
I tried to contact the office of the vice president, and all I could do was to send an email, which might
get lost among thousands .
I am hoping you see this and perhaps br ing this to the table. Blood centers use updated federal
information when educating donors, staff and hospitals but the current fea r is tr iggering blood drive
cancellations. This might be experienced nationally and will impact the national blood invento ry.
Thank you

Dear Dr. Fauci,
First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus,
especially your team at the NIAID. Your interviews are articulate and informative - they give Americans
some comfort and some concrete ways to t hink about protecting themselves and what to expect. It
must be a stressful ti me and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDCto
contain it and to help stave it off globally as well.
NIH-000965
On a happier note, I wanted to reach out and THANK YOU for all you do for our Down Syndrome
research through the transformative trans-NIH INCLUDEprogram. It is making a HUGE difference!!
To this end, I am writing today in hopes you will be able to join us on Wednesday, May 20th for our
AcceptAbili ty Gala at my head table. Attached is our save the date for the event . We are excited to have
Caroline Cardenas as our 2020 Ambassador, Rep Pete Stauber as our keynote (b)(6)
•--• , and Reps Lucille Roybal-Allard and Jaime Herrera Beutler are Global's Quincy Jones
Exceptional Advocacy Awardees. We believe the gala will be quite lovely and meaningfu l to so many .
We do understand that attendance cannot be considered if the coronavirus situation worsens. However,
if things are look ing much better (touch wood) we wou ld be deeply honored if you and our friends from
NIAID could attend. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
All the Best, Michelle and family

---------RE: Conference Planning with respect to coronavirus.
There is no way of knowing for sure. I would wait unti l May and see what the dynamics of the
outbreak are globally and make your decision then whether or not to cancel.

Subject : Conference Planning wit h respect to coronavirus.
Dear Dr. Fauci
Dr. Miriam Ke lty forme rly of NIH referred me to you . I am on the board of d irectors and planning
committee of the Applied Superconductivity Conference that is planned to be held in Tampa, Florida the
last week of July. Over 50% of our expected 1500 attendees are from outside the continental US. Our
planning committee appears to have three options :
1. Hold the conference on the original dates
2. Postpone the conference a few months
3. Cancel the confe rence
It would be most helpful to decision process if you can give us a prediction (anonymously of co urse) of
how the effects of the virus will pan out.
I look forward to your reply .

Dear Ms. Angel:
(b)(6)
(b)(6)
The severe complication of coronavirus are heavily skewed towards the elderly and those
with underlying conditions (Heart disease, Chronic lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes,
etc.) Most of the pneumon ias are pu re viral pneumonia and so this vaccination w ill not help
that. However, on the chance that you have a pure viral pneumonia that gets secondari ly
complicated by a bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcal) the vaccine would be beneficial. If
you are 65 years of age or older, you shou ld get the pneumonvax23 vaccine anyway
regardless of the risk of coronavirus infection.
Thanks,
Tony

Good evening!
I know you must be completely busy and inundated with people want ing your time. I apologize that I
have nothing to offer in return and completely understand if you don't have time to answer. I called
the CDCbut they were totally unhelpful. I have a question that makes sense to me and I was hoping
you could answer and the answer might help a lot of people.
I understand that over time I, and everyone else, will very likely get COVI0-19 and that most people
won't even realize it because it will be minor. I get that, so th is is not a panicked q uestion.
I also understand that while most cases wil l not be severe, the bad cases are compl icated by
pneumonia .
So my question is: If someone has been vaccinated against pneumonia, will that offer any protection
in the event that they do contract COVID-19 and perhaps provide some barrier against the worst
effects?
Thank you for your time if you have read this and I apologize if this is just another in a long line of
ignorant questions, but it made sense in my brain so I thought I would at least ask.
Be well, be happy, and may life be kind and generous to you, those you love, and those who love
you!
sincerely,
Aliantha Ange
