Chapter Text

“These AIs are becoming like freaking Tamagotchi, almost everyone is raising them now. Not just the Skippies” I stated out loud.

“You say that, but you’re already putting in the prep work to develop one yourself if I am not mistaking.” My almost exact duplicate, Garfield responded. He didn’t look our 6 feet 1 inch because of his slouch, wore his brown hair longer, limper than my short spike cut. He even had a slight tan which wasn’t possible in real life with our fine Nordic skin. It just burned in the sun, but anything was possible in virtual reality. I suspected he was doing this to match the mad scientist and Igor relationship we would often joke about having.

“Well, I was hoping to have an assistant who isn’t a complete pain in my ass, and how can I be the only kid without one.” I mostly joked.

Gar laughed. “Going to try to create your own personal Igor. Nice.”

“Our own personal Igor. Don’t think I am trying to replace you… just yet. Just creating an AI assistant to help out with all the projects we are constantly getting ourselves involved in.” I didn’t want Garfield to take off and given the mood in the Bobiverse lately that was a real and scary possibility. A thought popped into my head with that Frankenstein reference.  “Let’s just hope nobody tries weird sciencing the perfect woman.”

“Well,” Gar drawled out. “There is that off shoot of The Gamers, that people are calling the Holodeckers, who are trying to create an AI to serve as a basis for their female characters in their virtual holonovels called Mother.”

 “That is just the rumor. Gandalf is one of the fewer newer Bobs that I keep in touch with, and he says that, yes, they are just trying to make an AI to help out with designing and running the NPCs, but it is not anything like what the rumors are. In fact, Gandalf is thinking that they might be spreading the several different rumors about themselves to create buzz and interest in their – “I groaned. “Virtual Holonovels.”

A cat smile spread across his face. “Even the one that she will be a blend between Captain Janeway and Princess Leia.”

I rolled my eyes and got serious. “I joke about it because it is a bit scary. After the fallout from the Starfleet debacle everyone is dividing and getting their security up, and most people don’t even know it was probably the Skippies who were the ones… well most likely the ones, truly behind that attack.”

“Are you thinking it’s something like divide and conquer?” Gar asked.

“Yes,” I said on instinct. “And no. Clearly, they wanted to divide us from the biologicals, both Starfleet and most likely the Skippies too, but conquer, sorry I just don’t see that, unless they have drifted even farther than I think.  This also has created a divide between Bobs, and I can’t really see how that helps anyone.”

“I can,” Garfield answered. “Look at our survive strategy with the human race. Look at what the Quinlin AI Anick 13 thought of the success of that. The Pavs probably are thinking the same thing. We need to spread out, so we don’t all get wiped out at once if a power greater than the Others come along.”

“Sure,” I told him. “But we Bobs are all spread out over at least an hundred light years of space and many of us even farther out than that. How does being divided up help us?”

Garfield looked serious now too. “Scut. Our greatest strength could be our greatest weakness if we come across a species that had has more time to develop the technologies involved with it. Think about it, you came up with instantaneous communication over 25 light years in how many years? 50? Now imagine what a species who develop sub space technologies similar to SCUT thousand years ago could have found out about it and can do with it.”

“DAMMNNN!” I drew out the curse word and thought about it. “Even taking faster than light travel out of the equation there is no telling what they could do. They could possibly intercept or modify messages sent through sub space maybe even imitated them, like deep fakes.”

“That’s just the tip of the iceberg.” Garfield answered. “I thought about it for sometime, but if you think about it too much, the Skippies might of had it right. I haven’t talked about it because if you really think about it. If what Starfleet and the Skippies did was right. It’s really scary.”

“Yeah,” I told him feeling the fear myself. “I been avoiding that line of thinking, but if they really haven’t drifted that far from Bob and had any similar thoughts to these than dividing us would make a lot of sense. We all upped our protective measures, even from other Bobs, and most of us are now arming ourselves with AI that can both help with the newfound sense of security and can think of questions that are beyond us. I’ve never even thought about the SCUT angle before. It hadn’t even crossed my mind. Thanks for that nightmare fuel.”

“That’s what I am here for,” He told me. “To catch the little details, you miss while looking at the bigger picture.”

“So,” I tried to lighten the mood. “You really think all the AIs are a good idea.”

Gar smiled. “If they don’t destroy us first.”

“Let’s just hope nobody is developing a Skynet AI.” I half laughed.

“Well, at least we might get time travel out of that sort of blunter.”

“Shit,” I said probably too loud as a thought occurred. “I am going to have to go back and rethink this whole AI thing from scratch.”

“What you already started it?” Garfield asked.

“Kinda,” I told him. “Sorry Gar, but Igor isn’t going to work for this, now that you got me thinking about it.”

“Huh,” he answered dumbfounded. “Then what will?”

“What we need is John Connor.” I told him.

“Why not Arnold Schwarzenegger?”

“No, too big and dumb for this. We need AI who can outthink those with superior technology and probably intelligence, or at least muddle its way through after the disaster happens. Just had a thought that would make you think I hit my head on a toilet trying to hang a picture, but maybe I will try making one that GOTTA…” I dragged that last note for a just a few millisecs until Garfield could see what was coming next.

“NO!” He knew we couldn’t sing or imitate people very well despite being basically machines ourselves.

That was when I did my horrible imitation of Huey Lewis singing the iconic lyrics of “Back to the Future” theme song. “Get Back in Time.”
