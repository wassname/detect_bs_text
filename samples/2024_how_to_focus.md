# INTRODUCTION

Distraction is not a new problem tied to our technology. It’s something that people have struggled with for centuries, even at a time when books counted as newish devices and the main way to glance at the “clock” was to look outside at the sun. We’re not the first to complain about how hard it is to concentrate, or even to moralize the issue. Christian monks in the late Roman Empire beat us to it. Their work required intense concentration, which made them all the more aware of how hard it was to master.1

Like many of their contemporaries, monks saw cognition as an activity that both expressed who they were and made them what they were.2 Thinking about how to focus therefore amounted to thinking about how to live, as the person one wanted to be. And what monks wanted, in late antiquity, was to dedicate their lives and attention to God and to their ethical obligations within a divinely ordered universe.

The problem was that the mind \(like the self\) is an inherently slippery thing. John Cassian, whose thoughts about thinking influenced centuries of monks, wrote in the 420s that the mind “gets pushed around by random distractions.” It rifles through the past rather than staying fixed on the present. It thinks about dinner when it’s supposed to be concentrating on a psalm. It careens haphazardly between stimuli. It falls asleep during the night prayers. It wonders what time it is when it’s supposed to be buried in a book.

Many monks in Cassian’s day blamed demons for their lapses.3 These demons lurked all around them, shooting distracting thoughts at them that could cause serious harm if monks weren’t quick to react. Cassian agreed that demons were part of the problem, but he was also sure that distractedness was a human condition that could be mitigated by disciplining the mind, which involved examining and restructuring the conceptual, emotional, somatic, and social forces that were interlaced with monks’ mental activities. A large portion of his *Collationes*—that is, *Consultations*, or *Conversations*, or \(as it’s usually translated\) *The Conferences*—is dedicated to helping monks take up that training. As the historian and monk Columba Stewart has noted, “The question of focus is the single most important practical problem Cassian addresses in his monastic theology.”4 Although many elements of Cassian’s late antique anthropology and cosmology are far from our own concepts of cognition, we share with him an interest in combatting distraction and focusing on the things that matter to us. And what Cassian can offer, as an expert who has both succeeded and failed to focus, is advice that is at once more sympathetic and more sophisticated than what we’re used to.

## CASSIAN AND HIS WORK

John Cassian was a monk who lived in the Roman Empire in the fourth and early fifth centuries CE.5 These were still relatively early days in the history of Christian monasticism: Cassian was born in the 360s, as part of the generation that sought out the monastic pioneers in Egypt and the Levant who were old enough to be their parents and grandparents, to learn from them personally. The accounts that Cassian and others wrote about these encounters brought their role models international renown as the fathers and mothers of Christian monasticism. Cassian himself actually made it into that canon, too, alongside his personal heroes: he makes a cameo appearance in the immensely popular *Apophthegmata patrum* or *Sayings of the Desert Elders*, stories that circulated for centuries throughout Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, and Europe.6

It’s not certain where in the empire Cassian was born, but we do know that he joined his first monastery in Bethlehem when he was in his twenties, with a close friend named Germanus. From there the two struck out to Scetis and other monastic communities in the Nile delta, where they spent around fifteen years interviewing and learning from monastic elders in the hopes of becoming better practitioners themselves. When Egyptian monasticism became roiled by debates about the teachings of Evagrius—a monk who deeply influenced Cassian’s work, though Cassian never speaks of him directly—Cassian and Germanus fled to Constantinople and served in the ecclesiastical entourage of the imperial capital’s archbishop, John Chrysostom. But Chrysostom was a divisive figure, too, and when he was deposed and exiled only a few years later, Cassian and Germanus traveled to Rome in an effort to defend him. Historians don’t know what became of Germanus after that, but Cassian eventually moved to southern Gaul, by the 410s at the latest, when he would have been in his fifties. This was no quiet provincial getaway. By the time Cassian arrived in Gaul, political authority at both the imperial and the local levels had been sharply contested in this region for a few decades. Cassian found that the Christians he met there, rich and influential Christians in particular, were hungry for stories of what he’d learned in Egypt, searching as they were for moral exemplars and authoritative models of leadership. So in the 420s he narrativized the most memorable conversations he’d had with Germanus and their Egyptian mentors and sculpted them into an argument for living ethically, day by day, while coming to terms with one’s error-prone, ever-moving mind: this was the *Collationes*.

Given the sheer diversity of monastic models and forms of spiritual authority in late antiquity, it’s all the more remarkable that the *Collationes*, together with Cassian’s *De institutis coenobiorum* \(*The Foundations of Monastic Communities*, better known as *The Institutes*\), became such influential texts. One hagiographer tells us that Cassian’s writings inspired a young North African abbot named Fulgentius to set sail for Egypt in the later fifth century, to meet the holy monks whom he already saw as his “parents.” But he never made it there, his hagiographer tells us: Fulgentius got so excited talking about Cassian’s work at a dinner with the bishop of Syracuse that the bishop persuaded him to stay in Sicily. Another hagiographer noted that by the late sixth century the abbot John of Réomé had earned the respect of the most powerful people in Gaul, not least because he meditated on the *Instituta* and the *Collationes*—especially the books featuring Abba Isaac—and in the process kept his mind from getting distracted. And the *Rule of Benedict*, a Latin text that eventually became the most popular reference point for monastic discipline in Europe, presented Cassian’s work as recommended reading and advised monks to listen to the *Collationes* after dinner and on fast days: these were times when the mind needed something energizing but not arousing.7

These are just a few of many examples. Cassian had many admiring readers, though his work, too, was controversial in some circles. His emphasis on lifelong disciplinary practices \(behavioral, social, cognitive\) as constitutive of an ethical life left its mark not only on monasticism but on Christianity more generally. That said, certain elements of Cassian’s work never quite entered mainstream medieval psychology, and they might seem as surprising today as they did in the fifth century.8

## ATTENTION IN THE *C**OLLATIONES*

One of the central preoccupations of the *Collationes* is the art of concentration. This art required many interlocking practices, and the diverse metaphors that Cassian and his interlocutors deploy reflect their sense of monastic practice as a multifaceted system of training. Distraction did not have a single solution. So like soldiers, monks disciplined themselves to respect chains of command and group norms that could sustain them in combat. Like athletes, monks conditioned their bodies. Like artisans, monks honed skills that were essential to their craft—in their case, reading, memorizing, and above all monitoring the mind and heart. All these forms of training were necessary because a monk’s spiritual growth depended on maintaining functional relationships between self and collective, mind and body, technique and reflection. Concentration on the divine wasn’t going to happen simply by resolving to think harder, because a monk’s mind was affected by the world in which it was embedded, by the fluctuating constraints of social networks, obligations, physical capacities, emotional states, knowledge, perceptions, and habits. Training across many domains was both ethically and psychologically necessary.

Practices that we recognize as the signature elements of Christian monasticism were, for Cassian, essential parts of that complex cognitive system. Renouncing property and family, joining a community of likeminded practitioners, avoiding sex, eating sparingly: these were all strategies to minimize the things that didn’t matter in order to stretch the mind out to God. But he also recommended forms of mental discipline that are accessible even to the nonmonks among us—think metacognitive habits, rather than major life changes—and this translation focuses on those. But for Cassian, they were only one part of the art of concentration.

He also insisted that attentiveness was not so much an achievement as a perpetual practice. Even the most expert monks got discouraged by distraction sometimes; the work was never over. But the highs could be exquisite—none more so, as far as Cassian was concerned, than what he called “fiery prayer.” This was for him the consummate form of attention. A monk experiencing fiery prayer was not only locked on God. He was so absorbed in the experience, so overcome by spiritual sensation that the mind was incapable of dissecting the moment into something more comprehensible and reductive. It was as close to an undistracted self as a monk could get.

But before diving into that deep form of attention, Cassian starts more straightforwardly. His guidebook \(and this translation\) begins with an orientation courtesy of the great Abba Moses, who tells Germanus and Cassian that, like everyone else who wants to acquire a skill, they will need short- and long-term goals. It’s too easy to get distracted otherwise: without a destination to guide its movements, the mind will take endless detours without even realizing it’s off course.

Cassian and Germanus know exactly what their ultimate goal is: the kingdom of God—both in the sense of salvation and also in the sense of an inner alignment with spiritual values in the present. But Moses has to help the friends identify the proximate goal that will help them get there, and that is clarity of heart, a state of being unmoved by disruptive tendencies within the self. With these goals, monks can map out their way and refer to those plans to reorient themselves when they get lost.

After all, the mind can never completely avoid interruptions and distractions. What it *can* do is be selective with the thoughts it encounters or generates along the way—to go along with the ones that make sense for its goals, and to leave behind the ones that don’t. We can’t stop our minds from moving around, but we can give them better or worse things to think about.

But even with a map in mind, monks still struggled. The selection from book 7 of the *Collationes* speaks to their frustrations. Cassian and Germanus vent to Abba Serenus: after all the time they’ve spent as monks in the desert, the only thing they seem to have acquired is a deeper awareness of their own inability to concentrate. When they feel themselves advancing toward their destinations, their minds are led off course by innumerable daily distractions—only to suddenly return to what they were supposed to be thinking about, then wander away again. Serenus cuts off their complaining when Germanus suggests that concentration has nothing to do with self-control. It’s natural for the mind to move around, Serenus grants, but where it goes and what it thinks about is up to us. Germanus and Cassian need more training.

In books 9 and 10, which are sometimes considered to be the culmination of the *Collationes*, Germanus and Cassian learn from Abba Isaac how to reach a state of total concentration—and more specifically, concentration in prayer, because as Isaac points out, sometimes we concentrate on things we shouldn’t.9

Although there are infinite permutations of prayer, depending on who is praying and what their mind is like in the moment, the monks are especially keen to experience fiery prayer, that state of losing touch with the outside world while the mind becomes illuminated and pours out thoughts in a powerful flow. \(Although the modern concept of flow was coined by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the metaphor of flow to describe attentive and absorptive thinking recurs throughout Cassian’s book.\)10 According to Isaac, what makes this state of mind possible is a sense of genuine feeling for the subject at hand, rather than a superficial commitment to it. Almost anything can catalyze this feeling, but it can’t be faked, and in all cases the necessary precondition is a calm and clear heart.

But Germanus and Cassian aren’t satisfied with this general advice. They want a particular method that they can reliably follow, to experience that absorptive concentration instead of constantly getting waylaid by distraction and struggling to refocus. Isaac suggests that they memorize a single line of text, a psalm verse that asks for God’s help, and to intone it as a kind of mantra or mnemonic throughout the day—not only as they settle down to meditate but *all the time*. The mantra would serve as a regular dosage of sage advice, to remind them of their priorities and goals. It would also be a constant companion, something to turn to in monks’ many moments of weakness. But for Germanus this advice is still not enough. The problem is getting circular. “How do we hold onto that verse?”

Abba Nesteros takes a different tack. He tells the pair to read and recite their sacred texts all the time, which should not only keep their minds busy but also saturate and transform them with images that will flush out unwanted thoughts and useless memories, even the stories and songs they learned as kids. You can’t just clean out your mind and leave it blank, Nesteros says. You’ve got to replace all those vivid images and ideas with other things to work with. Imagine your mind as a cool, calm sanctuary that will give you access to God. Store that vault with things you treasure, and eventually it will overflow with thoughts you actually want to be thinking.

In the last two books of the *Collationes* the abbas Theonas and Abraham offer some final words of encouragement and warning to Germanus and Cassian, who are still fighting to stay focused. Nobody can experience the divine all the time, Theonas assures them. The mind is bound to slip and fall. But you need to take the challenge seriously. Think of yourself as a tightrope walker, with the line stretched tight between yourselves and God. You need to be afraid of falling: *this* will help you take your concentration seriously\!

Germanus suggests to Abraham that maybe the best way to concentrate is to move back home. It would be easier to avoid distractions if he didn’t have to think about supporting himself and if he weren’t always getting so many visitors. Not a chance, says Abraham. The idea that you can escape to somewhere even more remote, or even more peaceful, is an empty fantasy. There will always be people to distract us, responsibilities to keep us busy, and opportunities to make us second-guess the choices we already made. Rather than give up on a life that generations of monks had already engineered to help themselves concentrate, they should treat small interruptions or challenges as beneficial breaks. Otherwise even the most focused minds will falter.

There is a great gulf between our age and the world of late antiquity. But Cassian was part of an enthusiastic and analytical subculture that speaks to struggles we share in common. Like early Christian monks, we are still easily distracted—and we keep wishing we weren’t. Sixteen hundred years later, their conversations still have things to teach us. And when Cassian and his interlocutors speak, they are simultaneously stern and empathetic, out of a conviction that it’s possible to make the mind stronger, but impossible to control it completely.





# NOTES ON THE TRANSLATION

In its full form, the *Collationes* consists of twenty-four consultations and around 150,000 words. The excerpts here are drawn from seven consultations and represent less than 10 percent of the whole—so this translation conveys only a fraction of what Cassian shared with his readers.11 But it operates in an undeniably premodern mode: compiling excerpts of treasured texts into abridgements or anthologies was common practice in late antique and medieval book culture. It was a way of drawing on the knowledge and traditions of prior generations while shifting it, like the twist of a kaleidoscope, into something different. Through curation and recombination, the old became new, offering insights that spoke to the questions and preoccupations of different audiences. Cassian’s work certainly received this treatment. Compilers set to abridging and excerpting the *Collationes* not long after Cassian had finished it, and even its enthusiastic monastic readers drew from it choosily. For instance, the abbot Eugippius of Castellum Lucullanum \(outside of Naples\) drew up a monastic rule in the sixth century that included two snippets of the *Collationes*, both of which emphasized the importance of keeping the mind attentive for the sake of screening sexual thoughts before they made a monk aroused. So although my selective use of Cassian speaks to contemporary interests, it’s also an extension of textual practices that are well over a millennium old.12

This translation counterbalances the modern and premodern in an even more basic way, in its effort to bridge fifth-century Latin and twenty-first-century American English. Cassian and the Christian monks of late antique Egypt developed a cognitive culture that is both relatable and foreign to us today. I wanted this translation to welcome readers into that world, to make it intelligible and to showcase its shrewd analyses of how minds work.13 That meant loosening up the English in a way that highlights the earnestness and tenacity of Cassian’s speakers, rather than replicating the sinuous and nested qualities of his very distinctive Latin and in the process making them sound stilted. At the same time, I also wanted to allow the monks to remain a bit strange—partly because they were quite self-consciously countercultural in their time, and also because their distinctly late antique attitudes can’t be fully assimilated into ours.14

Cassian himself knew that translations were both insufficient and illuminating. In his consultations with Abba Moses and Abba Isaac, he notes subtle differences between biblical passages as they’re rendered in Greek versus Latin: the comparison results in a sharper understanding of issues that the Latin on its own does not quite convey.15 But this doesn’t lead Cassian to conclude that translation is too misleading to be worth the undertaking. After all, the entire project of his *Collationes* relies on translation. The Egyptian elders whom Germanus and Cassian consulted mostly spoke in Coptic, through a Greek translator for the benefit of their guests; and then Cassian sculpted these sessions into Latin, the native language of his audiences in southern Gaul.16

A final point about my translation. When it comes to certain key terms in Cassian’s work, I’ve veered away from lexical choices that are common in English translations but which tend to distort our sense of the late antique text. The usual rendering for *vitium*, for example, is “vice”—a word that has acquired centuries of doctrinal associations that weren’t in play when Cassian was writing. He meant something more like “weakness” or “vulnerability.” Likewise *virtus* is flattened by the English “virtue,” because Cassian uses the term to convey the mix of masculinity, strength, and fitness that could help monks stay fixed on their goals. *Passio* is often translated as “passion,” but the word has its own dogmatic pedigree that effectively downplays the roiling reactions that Cassian was trying to understand and control.17 *Discretio* was not so much “discretion” \(in our sense of tact\) as it was a technical term for the detective work that monks were supposed to perform on their own thoughts—to determine which ones were good and which ones were dangerous distractions. And *puritas cordis*, usually expressed in English as “purity of heart,” is rendered here as “clarity” or “tranquility of heart” to underscore the psychological slant of Cassian’s spirituality. The term was his spin on the concept of *apatheia*, or freedom from emotional investments and reactionism: this was originally a Stoic ethic that Cassian’s teacher Evagrius had made central to monastic practice. But *apatheia* had become controversial by the time Cassian was writing, and some critics contended that to promote it was to imply that it was possible to control the self without any help from God. So Cassian proposed the heart as a kind of passageway: when the heart was clear and calm and stable, it amounted to an act of complete commitment or love that enabled the mind to stretch out to the divine.18 These are just a few of the most obvious examples where traditional translations tame the force of the original. The *Collationes* is an exploratory and experimental text, and I’ve tried to capture its sense of inquiry here.





# HOW TO FOCUS





# GOALS

Cassian and Germanus Consult Abba Moses of Scetis

The desert of Scetis: home to the most battle-tested monastic elders and their many perfect achievements. Abba Moses was the sweetest of all those extraordinary flowers there; his practical and also his contemplative powers were full of fragrance. I wanted to get some grounding in his teaching, so the holy abba Germanus and I *had* to seek him out. Germanus had been with me ever since we had entered the spiritual military and started basic training, and from then on, we were such inseparable bunkmates in both the monastic community and the desert that everyone remarked on the equality of our companionship and our sense of purpose. They said that we were one mind and soul in two bodies.

And now both of us were pouring out tears19 and begging Abba Moses to edify us with his words. \(We did this because we knew he was so notoriously strict that he’d agree to open the door of perfection only to people who longed for it in good faith and sought it out in a state of total anguish. He didn’t want to seem to be committing the crime of betrayal or giving into the impulse to show off. Revealing that door indiscriminately to people who weren’t up for it, or who were only sort of interested, would result in the disclosure of vital matters—things that only people seeking perfection should learn—to unworthy recipients who wouldn’t know what it all was worth.\) Eventually he was worn down by our pleas and began to speak.

“Every acquired skill and every discipline,” he said, “has a *scopos* and a *telos*, some immediate goal and some ultimate goal that is particular to it. Practitioners of any skilled craft will gladly and good-naturedly work through all their fatigue and risks and costs as they keep those goals in mind.20

“Take a farmer, for instance, who tirelessly breaks up the soil and plows through the untilled clods of his field over and over again, without giving up in the frost and ice or in the withering rays of the sun. He does this while keeping his eye on his immediate goal of clearing away all the thorns, purging all the vegetation, and crumbling the earth into a loamy texture. He is certain that this is the only way he’ll achieve his ultimate goal: a yield of copious produce and abundant grain that will enable him to live comfortably or even to build up his wealth. He’s even willing to draw down the produce from his storehouses when supplies are already getting low, and he works hard to entrust their seeds to the fallow farrows. He doesn’t see it as a shortage in the present, because he is focused on future harvests.

“Likewise the merchants who work in wholesale trade aren’t afraid of what might happen unexpectedly on the open sea. As long as the drive to profit propels them to an ultimate goal, there isn’t any hazard that scares them.

Not even the members of the earthly military who are stoked by ambition notice the ravages or dangers of their campaigns when they have the ultimate goal of honors and influence to look forward to. And they aren’t shattered by losses or battles in the moment, as long as they’re eagerly anticipating the ultimate goal of the promotion they’ve visualized for themselves.

“Our own profession has particular immediate and ultimate goals, too, and we devote all our labors tirelessly and even enthusiastically to them. This is why fasting doesn’t wear us out, why the fatigue from keeping vigil all night appeals to us, why constant reading and meditating on the scriptures is never enough for us, and why incessant work and nakedness and complete dispossession and this chilling expanse of solitude doesn’t scare us off. And it is undoubtedly why you yourselves rejected the affection of your families and turned away from your only homeland and from the delightful things in the world, traveling long distances so that you could visit us of all people—rednecks and hicks living in this desolate desert. So tell me: what are your immediate and ultimate goals? What’s compelling you two to endure all of this so willingly?”

Since Moses kept trying to elicit a response from us, we answered that the kingdom of the heavens was the reason to endure all these things.

He replied, “Nicely done\! You’ve given an incisive answer about your ultimate goal. But before anything else, you should really know what our scopos should be. I’m talking about our immediate goal, the thing we stick to all the time so that we’re eventually able to reach the ultimate goal.”

We openly admitted that we didn’t know. So he went on: “Like I said, there is a particular scopos that leads the way in every single skill and discipline. Think of it as an immediate goal for the soul, or a relentless mental attentiveness. If you don’t focus on it with all your effort and perseverance, you won’t be able to reach your ultimate goal and enjoy the payoff you’ve been waiting for.

“For instance, as I said before, the farmer whose ultimate goal is to live comfortably and prosperously off his plentiful yields of grain operates with the scopos or immediate goal of clearing all the thorns from his field and getting rid of all the weeds. He doesn’t assume that he’ll achieve his ultimate goal—getting rich—by doing nothing; he knows for certain that he’ll possess what he really wants to have only by means of his plan of hard work and hope.

“The same is true of the merchant. He never gives up the drive to procure merchandise, which is such a lucrative way for him to accumulate wealth. It would be pointless for him to pursue profit without deciding how to get there.

“As for people who want to be honored with some particular distinction the world has to offer: the first thing they do is decide what job or office to land on, so that by setting their hopes on the right course of action, they can arrive at their ultimate goal of the accolade they’ve always wanted.

“In the same way, when it comes to our own path, the end point is the kingdom of God. But as for what our scopos might be, we should really make a careful investigation. If we don’t figure it out like other people do, we’ll wear ourselves out to the point of exhaustion—all for nothing, because if we don’t follow a path, our work is a journey that goes nowhere.”

As we sat in astonishment at what he’d said, the old man made this proposition: “As we said, the ultimate goal that is specific to our profession is the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. And in fact our immediate goal, our scopos, is clarity and tranquility of the heart.21 Without that clarity, it’s totally impossible to reach the ultimate goal.

“So we should fix our navigation on this immediate goal, like we’re steering ourselves along a set line down a very straight route. And even if our thinking were to veer away from it a bit, we would hurry to set it in our sights again, like making a precise correction with a ruler—a ruler that keeps drawing all our ventures back to this one guideline and alerting us immediately if our mind takes even a little detour from the course in front of us.

“Take, for example, people who are trained in handling military projectiles. When they want to showcase their expertise in this skill in the presence of a king in some part of the world, they shoot their javelins or arrows at miniscule targets that have prizes depicted on them. They’re sure that the only way to obtain the ultimate goal of the prize they’re after is to follow the sightline of their immediate goal. And then in the end, they *do* get that ultimate goal, when they to stick to their set scopos.

“But if the target happened to be taken away, nobody—not even an inexperienced shooter who aimed way off the right trajectory—would know whether they’d deviated from the designated line, because they wouldn’t have any indicator to tell whether their aim was true or crooked. And the result of having dumped their useless shots into the open air would be that they couldn’t tell where they went wrong or where they were misled, obviously because there wouldn’t be any telltale sign of how far they’d gone off course. If your eye doesn’t know where to look, it can’t offer any guidance about where to adjust or realign your aim.

“So as I was saying, the ultimate goal that has been set before us is everlasting life, as the apostle Paul declared: ‘Ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.’ The scopos here is clarity of heart, and the word he used for it was ‘holiness,’ with good reason. Without clarity of heart, the ultimate goal he mentioned would be unattainable. It was as if he’d said in so many words ‘Ye have your scopos unto clarity of heart, and the end everlasting life.’ And the same blessed apostle literally used the word scopos in teaching us about this immediate goal. He said: ‘Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of the Lord.’

“The connection is more obvious in the Greek original: ‘I press toward the immediate goal’ is *kata skopon diōkō*. It’s as if he’d said, ‘with this immediate goal I forget the things behind me—the weaknesses of the person I was before—and I go after the ultimate goal of the celestial prize.’22

“And so whatever can point us toward this immediate goal of clarity and tranquility of heart should be followed with all our might, and whatever drags us away from it should be treated as a destructive and toxic thing. Everything we pursue and put up with, we do for the sake of this scopos. For its sake we disregard families, homelands, professional advancements, wealth, the world’s charms, really every single pleasurable thing: all to maintain a clear heart always.

“And once this immediate goal is in front of us, our actions and thoughts should always be steered along the straightest path toward achieving it. If it isn’t constantly propped up in front of our eyes, it would make all our efforts hollow and flimsy. It would be a waste—all that to no end, with no payoff.

“It would also stir up all sorts of conflicting thoughts. When the mind doesn’t have a headquarters to return to and to keep in close contact with, it will inevitably get bounced around by all sorts of distractions, and it will just keep taking on the shape of whatever external stimulus it comes across next.

“We have seen this at play among people who don’t put any stock in pricey assets—whether it’s piles of cash in gold and silver, or even luxe estates—only to be shaken up about a knife, a stylus, a needle, a pen.23 But if they were keeping their heart’s concentration tidy, there’s no way they would let small things clutter it up, given that they’d already decided to get rid of their sizeable and valuable holdings so as not to run into the same problem\!

“It’s often the case, for instance, that some people will guard a book so jealously that they can barely stand to let someone else read or even touch it. In the process, they turn opportunities to reap the rewards of being accommodating and charitable into opportunities to reap the rewards of intolerance and death. Although they’ve distributed all their wealth out of love for Christ, they still hold onto their heart’s old proclivity for the most insignificant things, and they can rapidly fly into a rage over them, just like those people who do not have apostolic charity and are rendered unproductive and sterile. The blessed apostle foresaw this in his spirit and said that ‘if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.’

“Clearly this proves that perfection can’t be attained the instant you strip yourself down, or deprive yourself of all your properties, or jettison your titles—unless you have that charity whose component parts the apostle described, this love that can be found only in the clarity and tranquility of the heart. After all, what does it mean to *not* be competitive, not be pompous, not be irritated, not be misleading, not misbehave, not be self-serving, not take pleasure in things that are wrong, not think about evil, and all the rest? What does it mean except to offer a refined and spotlessly clean heart to God always, and to keep it away from any and all psychological turbulence?

“And so everything we do and strive for should be done for the sake of clarity of heart. Solitude should be pursued for it. We know that we should take on fasts, vigils, manual labor, nakedness, reading, and other feats for it—so that we can condition our heart and keep it unharmed from all those toxic pathologies,24 climbing those steps to a perfect state of love. And if some legitimate and pressing task happens to come up and we can’t carry out our usual strict regimen, we shouldn’t get sad or angry or annoyed. The very point of our regimen is to overcome such disturbances\!

“After all, the advantages of fasting don’t make up for the loss incurred when we’re angry, and the benefits of reading don’t make up for the damage done when we despise a brother. We’re supposed to practice this series of exercises—fasts, vigils, isolation, meditating on the scriptures—for the sake of the fundamental scopos, for the sake of clarity of heart, which is love. We shouldn’t counteract this fundamental source of strength in us simply for the sake of our exercises. If something in the series has to be skipped, nothing will harm us as long as that power remains intact and unharmed. It won’t do us any good if we perform the entire sequence while having abandoned what we’ve said is the fundamental reason to accomplish anything.

“This is why people work quickly to set up and outfit themselves with the tools of whatever their trade is: the point isn’t to get their hands on some knick-knacks, or to lay claim to the bare value that the equipment itself might be worth, but to use them to gain expertise and attain the ultimate goal of the discipline they were designed for. So you see, fasts, vigils, meditating on the scriptures, nakedness, and total dispossession don’t amount to a state of perfection. They are only the tools of perfection, because the ultimate goal of our discipline doesn’t reside in them; it is reached *through* them.

“It’s useless to undertake these exercises if you’re satisfied with fixing your heart’s attention on them alone, as if they were the greatest good, rather than on achieving your ultimate goal—which is the whole reason to strive to do these exercises. Even with the tools of the discipline in your hands you’ll have expended all your effort and strength without knowing what the ultimate goal really is. Everything that is profitable is related to that goal. So anything that is capable of disturbing that clarity and calm of our mind, no matter how useful or essential it seems, should be treated as toxic. This is the ruler that will enable us to correct course from all our missteps and distractions, and to reach our desired goal along its clear straight line.”

## LATER IN THE CONVERSATION WITH MOSES

Germanus asked, “Why is it that—even when we don’t want it to happen—useless thoughts break in sneakily and secretly, without us even knowing, making it beyond difficult to notice and catch them, let alone kick them out? I mean, can the mind ever be free of such thoughts? Is it always going to be the target of scams like this?”

Moses said: “It’s truly impossible for the mind not to be interrupted by thoughts. But it *is* possible, for anyone who makes the effort, to welcome them in or kick them out. Their origin doesn’t have everything to do with us, but it’s up to us to reject or accept them. And yet, despite what we’ve said about the impossibility of the mind not being attacked by thoughts, we shouldn’t chalk everything up to assault and to the spirits who are trying to inflict these thoughts on us. That wouldn’t leave any room for the human will to be free, and we’d lose the drive to improve ourselves.25

“Instead I would say that it’s mainly through our doing that the nature of our thoughts can be improved and take shape—either as sacred and spiritual thoughts or as earthly and material ones. This is precisely the reason we take the time to read regularly and to meditate on the scriptures constantly: to create opportunities to furnish our memory with something spiritual. The reason we chant the psalms one after the other is so that the piercing pain of the conscience can be at hand to help us. And the reason we take the time to carry out vigils and fasts and prayers is so that our mind is expanded and gazes on celestial things rather than savoring what’s on earth. Conversely, when neglect creeps in and we stop doing these exercises, the mind will inevitably get stuck in the muck of its flaws, and it won’t be long before it turns to physical concerns, and collapses.

“So it’s fitting that the functioning of the heart is thought to closely resemble the workings of a millstone, which is set spinning when the rush of water propels the mechanism to rotate. There’s no way for the millstone to stop running as long as the water pressure is wheeling it around. But what the overseer can control is the choice of what to grind: wheat or barley or the dreaded darnel.26 This much is patently obvious: it has to mill whatever its operator pours into it.

“The mind is like that, too: it just can’t be free from the flux of thoughts while it’s wheeled around through the currents of the present life by the violent rapids rushing all around it. But through intentional and careful effort, it will determine what kind of materials it should throw out or process for its own use. As I’ve said, if we repeatedly meditate on the sacred scriptures; and if we elevate our memory to the recollection of spiritual subjects, a longing for perfection, and the hope of the ultimate bliss to come—then the spiritual thoughts that spring from our meditations will naturally keep our mind occupied.

“But if we’re overcome by laziness or neglect and get caught up in bad habits and pointless chitchat, or if we become entangled in mundane preoccupations and unnecessary concerns, it would be like supplying our mechanism with some kind of weed that is toxic to our heart. For according to the saying of the Lord Savior, where the treasure of our deeds or attention is, there will our heart necessarily abide.”

\[1.1\] Cum in heremo Sciti, ubi monachorum probatissimi patres et omnis commorabatur perfectio, abbatem Moysen, qui inter illos egregios flores suauius non solum actuali, uerum etiam theoretica uirtute fragrabat, institutione eius fundari cupiens expetissem una cum sancto abbate Germano \(cum quo mihi ab ipso tirocinio ac rudimentis militiae spiritalis ita indiuiduum deinceps contubernium tam in coenobio quam in heremo fuit, ut cuncti ad significandam sodalitatis ac propositi nostri parilitatem pronuntiarent unam mentem atque animam duobus inesse corporibus\),

pariterque ab eodem abbate aedificationis sermonem fusis lacrimis posceremus \(quippe cuius hunc animi rigorem manifestissime noueramus, ut nisi fideliter desiderantibus et cum omni cordis contritione quaerentibus nequaquam adquiesceret ianuam perfectionis aperire, ne scilicet, si passim uel nolentibus eam uel tepide sitientibus exhiberet, res necessarias et quae solis perfectionem cupientibus debent esse conpertae, indignis et fastidiose suscipientibus pandens aut iactantiae uitium aut proditionis crimen uideretur incurrere\), tandem fatigatus precibus nostris ita exorsus est.

\[1.2.1\] Omnes, inquit, artes ac disciplinae scopon quendam, id est destinationem, et telos, hoc est finem proprium habent, ad quem respiciens uniuscuiusque artis industrius adpetitor cunctos labores et pericula atque dispendia aequanimiter libenterque sustentat.

nam et agricola nunc torridos solis radios, nunc pruinas et glaciem non declinans terram infatigabiliter scindit et indomitas agri glaebas frequenti subigit uomere, dum scopon seruat, ut eam cunctis sentibus expurgatam uniuersisque graminibus absolutam in modum solubilis harenae exercendo comminuat, finem, id est perceptionem copiosarum frugum et exuberantiam segetum non alias adepturum se esse confidens, quo uel ipse deinceps uitam securus exigere uel suam possit amplificare substantiam. \[1.2.2\] referta etiam frugibus horrea libenter exhaurit easque putribus sulcis instanti labore commendat, praesentem deminutionem futurarum messium contemplatione non sentiens.

illi etiam, qui negotiationum solent exercere commercia, non incertos pelagi timent casus, non ulla discrimina perhorrescunt, dum ad finem quaestus spe praepeti prouocantur.

nec non etiam hi qui militiae mundialis ambitione flammantur, dum prospiciunt honorum ac potentiae finem, peregrinationum exitia ac pericula non sentiunt nec praesentibus aerumnis bellisque frangunter, dum propositum sibi dignitatis finem cupiunt obtinere.

\[1.2.3\] habet ergo et nostra professio scopon proprium ac finem suum, pro quo labores cunctos non solum infatigabiliter, uerum etiam gratanter inpendimus, ob quem nos ieiuniorum inedia non fatigat, uigiliarum lassitudo delectat, lectio ac meditatio scripturarum continuata non satiat, labor etiam incessabilis nuditasque et omnium rerum priuatio, horror quoque huius uastissimae solitudinis non deterret. ob quem uos ipsi procul dubio parentum spreuistis affectum et patrium solum ac delicias mundi tot pertransitis regionibus despexistis, ut ad nos homines rusticos et idiotas atque in hoc heremi squalore degentes peruenire possetis. propter quod respondete, inquit, mihi quae sit destinatio uestra uel finis, qui ad haec omnia libentissime sustinenda uos prouocat.

\[1.3\] Et cum persisteret nostram elicere super hac interrogatione sententiam, respondimus regni caelorum causa haec cuncta tolerari.

\[1.4.1\] Ad quod ille: Bene, inquit: argute de fine dixistis. qui uero debeat esse scopos noster, id est destinatio, cui iugiter inhaerentes finem ualeamus adtingere, prae omnibus nosse debetis.

et cum ignorationem confessi simpliciter fuissemus, adiecit: in omni ut dixi arte ac disciplina praecedit quidam scopos, id est animae destinatio siue incessabilis mentis intentio. quam nisi quis omni studio perseuerantiaque seruauerit, nec ad finem desiderati fructus poterit peruenire.

\[1.4.2\] nam ut dixi agricola finem habens secure copioseque uiuendi in prouentu segetum fecundarum scopon, id est destinationem gerit agrum suum cunctis sentibus expurgare eumque uniuersis infructuosis uacuare graminibus, nec aliter se quieti finis opulentiam adepturum esse confidit, nisi id, quod usu obtinere desiderat, quadam prius operis ac spei suae ratione possideat.

negotiator quoque conparandarum mercium desiderium non deponit, per quod possit quaestuosius diuitias congregare, quia frustra concupisceret lucrum, nisi uiam qua ad id tenderet elegisset.

et qui certis quibusque dignitatibus mundi huius cupiunt honorari, cui se officio uel ordini debeant mancipare ante proponunt, ut per legitimum spei tramitem finem quoque ualeant desideratae dignitatis adtingere.

\[1.4.3\] itaque et uiae nostrae finis quidem est regnum dei. quid uero sit scopos debet diligenter inquiri: qui si nobis similiter conpertus non fuerit, frustra nitendo fatigabimur, quia sine uia tendentibus labor est itineris, non profectus.

ad quod obstupescentibus nobis senex intulit: finis quidem nostrae professionis ut diximus regnum dei seu regnum caelorum est, destinatio uero, id est scopos, puritas cordis, sine qua ad illum finem inpossibile est quempiam peruenire.

\[1.4.4\] in hac ergo destinatione defigentes nostrae directionis obtutus uelut ad certam lineam cursum rectissimum dirigemus, ac si paululum quid ab hac cogitatio nostra deflexerit, ad contemplationem eius ilico recurrentes rursus eam uelut ad quandam normam rectissime corrigemus, quae semper omnes conatus nostros ad unum hoc reuocans signum arguet statim, si a proposita directione mens nostra uel paululum deuiauerit.

\[1.5.1\] Quemadmodum hi, quibus usus est bellica tela tractandi, cum ante regem mundi huius artis suae cupiunt peritiam demonstrare, in paruissima quaedam scutula, quae depicta in se continent praemia, iacula uel sagittas intorquere contendunt, certi quod non alias nisi destinationis suae linea ad finem possint desiderati praemii peruenire, quo tum demum utique potientur, cum propositum scopon ualuerint obtinere:

qui si forte ab eorum fuerit subtractus intuitu, quantumlibet a recto tramite cassa imperitorum deerret intentio, excidisse se tamen ab illius disciplinatae lineae directione non sentient, quia nullum habent certum signum quod uel peritiam directionis probet uel arguat prauitatem. et ideo cum inutiles in aëra uacuumque fuderint iactus, in quo peccauerint quoue decepti sint diiudicare non possunt, quippe quos nullum accusat indicium quantum a directione discesserint, nec quo deinceps corrigere uel reuocare debeant lineam disciplinae docere potest passiuus obtutus.

\[1.5.2\] ita igitur et nostri propositi finis quidem secundum apostolum uita aeterna est, ita eodem pronuntiante: habentes quidem fructum uestrum in sanctificationem, finem uero uitam aeternam, scopos uero est puritas cordis, quam sanctificationem non inmerito nuncupauit, sine qua praedictus finis non poterit adprehendi, acsi dixisset aliis uerbis: habentes quidem scopon uestrum in cordis puritate, finem uero uitam aeternam. de qua destinatione docens nos idem beatus apostolus ipsum nomen, id est scopon, significanter expressit ita dicens: quae posteriora sunt obliuiscens, ad ea uero quae in ante sunt extendens me, ad destinatum persequor, ad brauium supernae uocationis domini.

\[1.5.3\] quod euidentius in Graeco ponitur *κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω*, id est secundum destinationem persequor, tamquam si dixisset: hac destinatione qua illa quae posteriora sunt obliuiscor, id est anterioris hominis uitia, ad finem brauii caelestis peruenire contendo.

quidquid ergo nos ad hunc scopon, id est puritatem cordis potest dirigere, tota uirtute sectandum est, quidquid autem ab hac retrahit, ut perniciosum ac noxium deuitandum. pro hac enim uniuersa agimus atque toleramus, pro hac parentes, patria, dignitates, diuitiae, deliciae mundi huius et uoluptas uniuersa contemnitur, ut scilicet puritas cordis perpetua retentetur.

\[1.5.4\] hac itaque nobis destinatione proposita semper actus nostri et cogitationes ad eam obtinendam rectissime dirigentur. quae si prae oculis nostris iugiter statuta non fuerit, non solum cunctos labores nostros uacuos pariter atque instabiles reddens in cassum eos ac sine ullo emolumento conpellet effundi,

sed etiam cogitationes omnes diuersas sibique contrarias suscitabit. necesse est enim mentem quo recurrat cuiue principaliter inhaereat non habentem per singulas horas atque momenta pro incursuum uarietate mutari atque ex his quae extrinsecus accedunt in illum statum continuo transformari qui sibi primus occurrerit.

\[1.6.1\] Hinc namque est quod nonnullos mundi huius maximas facultates et non solum multa auri atque argenti talenta, uerum etiam praediorum magnificentiam contemnentes post haec uidimus pro scalpello, pro graphio, pro acu, pro calamo commoueri. qui si contemplationem cordis mundi fixam tenerent, numquam utique pro paruis rebus admitterent, quod ne pro magnis ac pretiosis incurrerent opibus, easdem penitus abicere maluerunt.

\[1.6.2\] nam et plerumque nonnulli tanto zelo codicem seruant, ut eum ne leuiter quidem legi uel contingi ab aliquo sinant, et inde occasiones inpatientiae ac mortis incurrunt, unde monentur stipendia patientiae et caritatis adquirere, cumque omnes diuitias suas pro Christi amore disperserint, pristinum tamen cordis affectum in rebus minimis retentantes et pro ipsis nonnumquam mobiliter irascentes, ueluti qui non habeant apostolicam caritatem, ex omnibus infructuosi sterilesque redduntur. quod in spiritu beatus apostolus praeuidens et si distribuero, inquit, in cibos pauperum omnes facultates meas et tradidero corpus meum ut ardeam, caritatem autem non habuero, nihil mihi prodest.

\[1.6.3\] unde liquido conprobatur perfectionem non statim nuditate nec priuatione omnium facultatum seu dignitatum abiectione contingi, nisi fuerit caritas illa cuius apostolus membra describit, quae in sola cordis puritate consistit. nam quid est aliud non aemulari, non inflari, non inritari, non agere perperam, non quaerere quae sua sunt, non super iniquitate gaudere, non cogitare malum et reliqua, nisi cor perfectum atque mundissimum deo semper offerre et intactum a cunctis perturbationibus custodire?

\[1.7.1\] Omnia igitur huius gratia gerenda adpetendaque sunt nobis. pro hac solitudo sectanda est, pro hac ieiunia, uigilias, labores, corporis nuditatem, lectionem ceterasque uirtutes debere nos suscipere nouerimus, ut scilicet per illas ab uniuersis passionibus noxiis inlaesum parare cor nostrum et conseruare possimus et ad perfectionem caritatis istis gradibus innitendo conscendere, et non propter has obseruantias, si forte honesta ac necessaria occupatione praeuenti sollemnitatem districtionis nostrae non potuerimus implere, incidamus in tristitiam uel iram siue indignationem, ob quae expugnanda illud quod praetermissum est fueramus acturi.

\[1.7.2\] non enim tantum est lucrum ieiunii quantum irae dispendium nec tantus lectione capitur fructus quantum contemptu fratris incurritur detrimentum. ea igitur quae sequentia sunt, id est ieiunia, uigiliae, anachoresis, meditatio scripturarum, propter principalem scopon, id est puritatem cordis, quod est caritas, nos conuenit exercere et non propter illa principalem hanc proturbare uirtutem, qua in nobis integra inlaesaque durante nihil oberit, si aliquid eorum quae sequentia sunt pro necessitate fuerit praetermissum: siquidem nec proderit uniuersa fecisse adempta hac qua diximus principali causa, cuius obtentu sunt omnia peragenda.

\[1.7.3\] ob hoc enim quis ferramenta cuiuslibet artis instituere sibimet ac praeparare festinat, non ut ea possideat otiosa nec ut emolumenti illius fructum qui speratur ex ipsis in nuda instrumentorum possessione constituat, sed ut eorum ministerio peritiam finemque illius disciplinae cuius haec adiumenta sunt efficaciter adprehendat. igitur ieiunia, uigiliae, meditatio scripturarum, nuditas ac priuatio omnium facultatum non perfectio, sed perfectionis instrumenta sunt, quia non in ipsis consistit disciplinae illius finis, sed per illa peruenitur ad finem.

\[1.7.4\] in cassum igitur haec exercitia molietur, quisque his uelut summo bono contentus intentionem sui cordis huc usque defixerit et non ad capiendum finem, propter quem haec adpetenda sunt, omne studium uirtutis extenderit, habens quidem disciplinae illius instrumenta, finem uero, in quo omnis fructus consistit, ignorans. quidquid igitur potest istam mentis nostrae puritatem tranquillitatemque turbare, quamuis utile ac necessarium uideatur, ut noxium deuitandum est. hac enim norma et errorum peruagationumque omnium dispersiones poterimus euadere et desideratum finem linea certae directionis adtingere.

\[1.16\] GERMANVS: Quid ergo est quod etiam nolentibus, immo uero etiam nescientibus nobis ita superfluae cogitationes subtiliter ac latenter inrepunt, ut non solum eas expellere, uerum etiam intellegere ac deprehendere difficultatis inmodicae sit? potest ergo mens aliquando ab istis uacua repperiri et numquam huiuscemodi inlusionibus incursari?

\[1.17.1\] MOYSES: Mentem quidem non interpellari cogitationibus inpossibile est, suscipere uero eas siue respuere omni studenti possibile est. quemadmodum igitur ortus earum non omnimodis pendet a nobis, ita reprobatio uel electio consistit in nobis. nec tamen ex eo quod diximus inpossibile esse mentem cogitationibus non adiri, totum uel incursui uel illis spiritibus tribuendum est qui eas nobis nituntur ingerere. alioquin nec liberum in homine maneret arbitrium nec in nobis staret nostrae correctionis industria.

\[1.17.2\] sed est, inquam, nostrum magna ex parte, ut cogitationum qualitas emendetur et uel sanctae ac spiritales in cordibus nostris uel terrenae carnalesque concrescant. ideo namque frequens lectio et iugis adhibetur meditatio scripturarum, ut exinde nobis spiritalis memoriae praebeatur occasio, idcirco decantatio crebra psalmorum, ut adsidua nobis exinde conpunctio ministretur, idcirco uigiliarum ac ieiuniorum orationumque sedulitas adhibetur, ut extenuata mens non terrena sapiat, sed caelestia contempletur. quibus rursum neglegentia inrepente cessantibus necesse est ut mens uitiorum squalore concreta in carnalem partem mox inclinetur et conruat.

\[1.18.1\] Quod exercitium cordis non incongrue molarum similitudini conparatur, quas meatus aquarum praeceps impetu rotante prouoluit. quae nullatenus quidem cessare possunt ab opere suo aquarum inpulsibus circumactae: in eius uero qui praeest situm est potestate, utrumnam triticum malit an hordeum loliumue comminui. illud quippe est procul dubio conmolendum, quod ingestum ab illo fuerit cui operis illius cura commissa est.

\[1.18.2\] ita igitur etiam mens per uitae praesentis incursus undique ingruentibus temptationum torrentibus circumacta uacua quidem cogitationum aestibus esse non poterit: quales uero uel amittere uel parare sibi debeat, studii ac diligentiae suae prouidebit industria. si enim ut diximus ad sanctarum scripturarum meditationem iugiter recurramus ac memoriam nostram ad recordationem spiritalium rerum et desiderium perfectionis spemque futurae beatitudinis erigamus, necesse est ut ortae cogitationes exinde spiritales in his quae meditati sumus mentem faciant inmorari.

\[1.18.3\] sin uero desidia seu neglegentia superati uitiis et otiosis confabulationibus occupemur seu curis mundanis et superfluis sollicitudinibus inplicemur, consequenter exinde uelut quaedam zizaniorum species generata operationem quoque nostro cordi noxiam ministrabit, et secundum sententiam domini saluatoris ubi fuerit thesaurus operum seu intentionis nostrae, ibi et cor nostrum necessario permanebit.
